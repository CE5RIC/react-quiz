Time to create a quiz with React!

So first and foremost we are going to use an API to generate this quiz.
We're not going to hardcode 100 questions right?
This API has been provided by our Becode coaches so, we can start fetching!

Going to take care of this first, let's display a question for starters.
Then we will worry about separating everything component wise and think of the
type of quiz we want to build. Maybe "Who wants to be a millionaire?".
